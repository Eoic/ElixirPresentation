Created in min-1980s by Erricson, because of the needs for reliability, scalability, responsiveness, and constant availability.

It's a general purpose development platform.

Today, we face a much different situation: the focus is on the internet and the web, and most applications are driven and supported by a server system that processes requests, crunches data, and pushes relevant information to many connected clients. Today’s popular systems are more about communication and collaboration; examples include social networks, content-management systems, on-demand multimedia, and multiplayer games.

Today's systems have a very similar non-functional requirements: These systems have some nonfunctional requirements in common. The system
must be responsive, regardless of the number of connected clients. The effects of
unexpected errors must be minimal, instead of affecting the entire system. It’s accept-
able if an occasional request fails due to a bug, but it’s a major problem if the entire
system to becomes completely unavailable. Ideally, the system should never crash or
be taken down, not even during a software upgrade. It should always be up and running, providing service to its clients.
