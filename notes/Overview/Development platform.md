Erlang platforms consists of:
1. The language
2. The virtual machine (BEAM)
3. The framework (OTP)
4. The tools - compiling code, starting BEAM instances, connecting to BEAM instances, creating releases, etc.

Source code is compiled into byte code, that is executed on the BEAM.

OTP (an integral part of the Erlang language, hard to draw line between the two):
1. Concurrency and distribution patterns.
2. Error detection and recovery in concurrent systems.
3. Packaging code into libraries.
4. System deployment.
5. Live code updates.
