* Elixir code consists of modules and functions.
* It's a dynamic language - type is determined by the value that the variable holds.
* Data is immutable (cannot be modified). 
* Important types - numbers, atoms, binaries.
* No strings, nulls or bools. Former is represented as binaries, the other two - as atoms.
* Built-in complex types - tuples, lists, maps.
* Functions are first-class citizens.
* Module names are atoms, that correspond to `.beam` files on disk.
