In 1998 Erlang was banned by Ericsson to avoid costs of developing the language that was unique to the company (a proprietary product). Instead, it was decided to use open-source languages. Erlang was open sources the same year. However, the ban was lifted in 2004.

> The selection of an implementation language implies a more ==long-term commitment ==than the selection of a processor and OS, due to the longer life cycle of implemented products. Use of ==a proprietary language implies a continued effort== to maintain and further develop the support and the development environment. It further implies that ==we cannot easily benefit== from, and find synergy with, the evolution ==following the large-scale deployment of globally used languages.==

However, existing products still needed maintenance. Also, there were a lot of success with clients using Erlang under NDA.
